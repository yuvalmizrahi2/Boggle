The first program is the game is Nim.

Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap. The goal of the game is to avoid being the player who must remove the last object.

The game is against the computer.

The game goes like this: the players choose the size of the three packets,and now in each turn the players need tp change the number in the packets.

The looser is the one who has only 1 in a packets when the rest are empty.

In this game the computer always wins.

Give it a try and see if you can break all odds, and let me know.
