The famous game Min.
The game is against the computer.
The game goes like this: the players choose the size of the three packets,and now in each turn the players need tp change the number in the packets.
The looser is the one who has only 1 in a packets when the rest are empty.
In this game the computer always wins.
Give it a try and see if you can break all odds, and let me know.
